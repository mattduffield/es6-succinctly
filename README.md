# es6-succinctly

Code sample to accompany the book.

## Dependencies

This sample takes advantage of transpiling the code using **Ctrl+B** on Windows or **Cmd+B** on Mac.  To do this you must use the following tool:

* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io/)

Please refer to the book for configuring Sublime for build the samples provided.

## Platform Support

This library can be used in the **browser** and in **node**.

## Building The Code

The samples provided use BabelJS as the transpiler.  These need to be installed in order for the samples to work.  Please use the following steps to ensure you environment is ready:

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

	```shell
	npm install
	```

## Running The Examples

To run the examples, you simply need to press **Ctrl+B** on Windows or **Cmd+B** on Mac.  You will see the output of transpiling the code in the output window in Sublime.
